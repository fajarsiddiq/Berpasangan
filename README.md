# Berpasangan
A card matching game that tests your knowledge and memory! 
All you have to do is matching the monument with its corresponding flag of origin country. Be careful, there's a time limit though. And challenge yourself to complete the game with high accuracy (so no brute-force, please :)).

Sounds interesting? Here's the screenshots :

It's currently in development stage, so the UI can be changed significantly (so please bear with bad color combination in this current stage :))! Even though several elements aren't implemented yet (like store or encyclopedia), the basic gameplay can be played right away.
